1. Make sure you add the SSAT files to the folder: "Add SSAT problems here"
2. Click Run in xcode.
3. Then enter the file name in the space provided and click start.
4. To run another, simply change the file name and click start.

Included problems: "problem1" "problem2"  "problem3" "test6"

Notes:
The files should be in .cnf format with a list of numbers with their probabilities (or -1 for choice variable) next to them, as seen below.

This algorithm requires that four spaces exist before nonnegated literals and three spaces exist before negated literals in a clause. 4 spaces between the last literal of a clause and the trailing zero is also required. No additional  formatting dependencies exist. This also makes it more human readable.

This algorithm requires the .cnf files to have:
A: Three or four spaces exist between literals in a clause.
B: Four spaces between the last literal of a clause.
C: A trailing zero is also required. (see example .cnf files)
